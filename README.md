# Design-of-Armoured-Suit-Systems-for-Defense-Vehicles
B.Tech Final Year Project

Abstractâ€” In response to the critical need for enhanced protection of armored vehicles and convoys, this project introduces an innovative defense system to actively protect a designated vehicle. Central to its functionality are advanced sensors strategically integrated into the vehicles, diligently monitoring the distance between the vehicle and any potential projectiles. The system leverages real-time data analysis to establish a predefined danger zone, and when the tracked projectile breaches this threshold, an automated reaction is triggered. This proactive response is designed to fortify the defense capabilities of armored assets, mitigating potential risks and fortifying the safety of the convoy. The implementation of this defense system marks a significant advancement in vehicular security, providing a dynamic and adaptive shield against potential threats. The integration of cutting-edge sensor technology and automated response mechanisms ensures that the defense system operates seamlessly, offering a rapid and effective countermeasure to potential dangers. By focusing on preemptive action based on real-time data, this project aims protect by active armoural suit system for armored vehicles, contributing to heightened security and safeguarding the lives of those within the convoy.
